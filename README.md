# Chat + Vision using Azure OpenAI (Python)

This is an Python app using Azure OpenAI vision capabilities to chat with uploaded images. This is a personal repo for the app I use to transcribe handwritten notes. If you want to build an app like this, start from the azd template: [Multimodal GenAI experience: Q&A on uploaded images](https://azure.github.io/ai-app-templates/repo/azure-samples/openai-chat-vision-quickstart/) created by Pamela Fox.


The template includes all the infrastructure and configuration needed to provision Azure OpenAI resources and deploy the app to [Azure Container Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/overview) using the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview). By default, the app will use managed identity to authenticate with Azure OpenAI, and it will deploy a GPT-4o model with the GlobalStandard SKU.

## Features

* A Python [Quart](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/) that uses the [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/) package to generate responses to user messages with uploaded image files.
* A basic HTML/JS frontend that streams responses from the backend using [JSON Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) over a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).
* Speech input and output buttons that use the free built-in browser APIs.
* [Bicep files](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/) for provisioning Azure resources, including Azure OpenAI, Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Registry, Azure Log Analytics, and RBAC roles.
* Support for using [GitHub models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) during development.

## Getting started

Check out the template [here](https://azure.github.io/ai-app-templates/repo/azure-samples/openai-chat-vision-quickstart/)


### Deploying with azd

1. Login to Azure:

    ```shell
    azd auth login
    ```

2. Provision and deploy all the resources:

    ```shell
    azd up
    ```

    It will prompt you to provide an `azd` environment name (like "chat-app"), select a subscription from your Azure account, and select a [location where OpenAI is available](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/products-by-region/?products=cognitive-services&regions=all) (like "francecentral"). Then it will provision the resources in your account and deploy the latest code. If you get an error or timeout with deployment, changing the location can help, as there may be availability constraints for the OpenAI resource.

3. When `azd` has finished deploying, you'll see an endpoint URI in the command output. Visit that URI, and you should see the chat app! üéâ
4. When you've made any changes to the app code, you can just run:

    ```shell
    azd deploy
    ```

### Continuous deployment with GitHub Actions

This project includes a Github workflow for deploying the resources to Azure
on every push to main. That workflow requires several Azure-related authentication secrets
to be stored as Github action secrets. To set that up, run:

```shell
azd pipeline config
```

## Development server

In order to run this app, you need to either have an Azure OpenAI account deployed (from the [deploying steps](#deploying)) or use a model from [GitHub models](https://github.com/marketplace/models).

1. If you already deployed the app using `azd up`, then a `.env` file was created with the necessary environment variables, and you can skip to step 3.

2. To use the app with GitHub models, either copy `.env.sample` into a `.env` file or start from the created `.env` file.
    Change `OPENAI_HOST` to "github" in the `.env` file.

    You'll need a `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable that stores a GitHub personal access token.
    If you're running this inside a GitHub Codespace, the token will be automatically available.
    If not, generate a new [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and run this command to set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable:

    ```shell
    export GITHUB_TOKEN="<your-github-token-goes-here>"
    ```

3. Start the development server:

    ```shell
    python -m quart --app src.quartapp run --port 50505 --reload
    ```

    This will start the app on port 50505, and you can access it at `http://localhost:50505`.

## Guidance

### Costs

Pricing varies per region and usage, so it isn't possible to predict exact costs for your usage.
The majority of the Azure resources used in this infrastructure are on usage-based pricing tiers.
However, Azure Container Registry has a fixed cost per registry per day.

You can try the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.com/e/3987c81282c84410b491d28094030c9a) for the resources:

* Azure OpenAI Service: S0 tier, GPT-4o model. Pricing is based on token count. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)
* Azure Container App: Consumption tier with 0.5 CPU, 1GiB memory/storage. Pricing is based on resource allocation, and each month allows for a certain amount of free usage. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-apps/)
* Azure Container Registry: Basic tier. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/container-registry/)
* Log analytics: Pay-as-you-go tier. Costs based on data ingested. [Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/)

‚ö†Ô∏è To avoid unnecessary costs, remember to take down your app if it's no longer in use,
either by deleting the resource group in the Portal or running `azd down`.

### Security guidelines

This template uses [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview) for authenticating to the Azure OpenAI service.

Additionally, we have added a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/microsoft/security-devops-action) that scans the infrastructure-as-code files and generates a report containing any detected issues. To ensure continued best practices in your own repository, we recommend that anyone creating solutions based on our templates ensure that the [Github secret scanning](https://docs.github.com/code-security/secret-scanning/about-secret-scanning) setting is enabled.

You may want to consider additional security measures, such as:

* Protecting the Azure Container Apps instance with a [firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/waf-app-gateway) and/or [Virtual Network](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/container-apps/networking?tabs=workload-profiles-env%2Cazure-cli).
